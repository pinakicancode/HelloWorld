This is Pinaki. And I am trying to learn how Github works.
Thank you for bearing with me.

My learning: 
- Create a **Repositiory** with a readme file
  - The **main branch** is for production
  - Mention information in readme
- Create a **New Branch** to make any changes
  - Changes to this branch will not affect the main branch
- When we have validated the changes, we can
  - **Open** a *Pull Request*; You can tag someone with '@' to request validation
  - **Compare** the *Changes* (red & green) for deletions & additions to the file in main
  - **Create** the *Pull Request* 
- **Merge** *Pull Request* from current branch to main branch
- **Delete** current branch once merge has completed
